Today's \emph{information networks}, such as World Wide Web and Online social networks, are inherently \emph{heterogeneous} and \emph{dynamic} as they consist of multi-typed objects and relations, and are constantly evolving over time. One of the challenging issues in such networks is to forecast those relationships that will appear in the future. In this paper, we try to solve the problem of continuous-time link prediction in dynamic and heterogeneous information networks.
This implies predicting the time it takes for a relationship to appear in the future, given its features that have been extracted by considering both heterogeneity and temporal dynamics of the underlying network.
To this end, we first introduce a feature extraction framework that combines the power of meta-path-based modeling and recurrent neural networks to effectively extract features suitable for link prediction regarding heterogeneity and dynamicity of the networks. Next, we propose a supervised non-parametric approach, called \emph{Non-Parametric Generalized Linear Model} (\npglm), which infers the underlying distribution of the relationship building time given its features.
%We then present a learning algorithm to train \npglm and an inference method to answer time-related queries. 
Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets, Delicious and MovieLens, demonstrate the effectiveness of \npglm in solving the problem vis-\`a-vis competitive baselines\footnote{Codes and data are available at \url{https://github.com/sisaman/npglm-codes}}.
