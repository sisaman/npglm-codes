\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we studied the problem of continuous-time link prediction in both dynamic and heterogeneous information networks. To effectively tackle this problem, we first introduced a novel feature extraction framework based on meta-path modeling and recurrent neural network autoencoders to systematically extract features that take both the temporal dynamics and heterogeneous characteristics of the network into account. We then proposed a supervised non-parametric model, called \npglm, which exploits the extracted features to predict the link formation time in information networks. The strength of our model is that it does not impose any significant assumptions on the underlying distribution of the link formation time given its features, but tries to infer it from the data via a non-parametric approach. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets from Delicious and MovieLens demonstrated the correctness of our method and its effectiveness in predicting the link formation time.
