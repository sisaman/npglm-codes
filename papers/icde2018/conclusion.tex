\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we studied the problem of continuous-time relationship prediction in both dynamic and heterogeneous information networks. To effectively tackle this problem, we first introduced a meta-path based feature extraction framework to systematically extract features suitable for solving the continuous-time relationship problem which takes both the temporal dynamics and heterogeneous characteristics of the network into account. We then proposed a supervised non-parametric model, called \npglm, which exploits the extracted features to predict the relationship building time in information networks. The strength of our model is that it does not impose any significant assumption on the underlying distribution of the relationship building time given its features, but tries to infer it from the data via a non-parametric approach. Extensive experiments conducted on both synthetic dataset and real-world DBLP bibliographic network demonstrated the correctness of our method and its effectiveness in predicting the relationship building time.\\
